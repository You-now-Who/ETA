# 🕐 ETA: The App That Judges Your Time Estimation Skills Harder Than You Judge Your Life Choices

*"It'll only take 5 minutes!" - Famous last words that this app will absolutely destroy*

## 🎯 What is This Beautiful Disaster?

ETA is the app you knew that you neeeded but never found the time to make. It's like having a personal trainer, but instead of making you sweat at the gym, it makes you sweat when you realize you estimated "2 hours" for a task that took you 3 days, 4 mental breakdowns, and a family intervention.

## 🤔 Why Does This Exist?

Have you ever told someone you'd be ready in "just 5 minutes" and then showed up 45 minutes later with wet hair and one shoe? Have you ever estimated a project would take "a quick afternoon" and then finished it sometime during the next lunar eclipse? 

Congratulations! You're human! And this app is here to shame you into improvement with the power of SCIENCE! 📊

## 🚀 Features That Will Change Your Life (Or At Least Make You Aware of How Bad You Are)

### 🎲 The "I'm Feeling Lucky" Predictor
- Make time predictions with confidence intervals! 
- Watch in horror as your 95% confidence interval gets violated more often than terms of service agreements
- Feel the sweet, sweet pain of being wrong in a statistically significant way

### 📈 Calibration Charts That Don't Lie
- Beautiful graphs that show exactly how terrible you are at estimating time
- Color-coded shame levels: Green (unicorn), Yellow (human), Red (maybe seek help)
- Interactive charts that judge you silently but effectively

### 🏷️ Task Categorization for Maximum Embarrassment
- Tag your failures by type: "Coding", "Meetings", "Getting Ready", "Quick Email"
- Discover which category of task you're worst at (spoiler: it's all of them)
- Watch patterns emerge like "I consistently underestimate anything involving other humans"

### 💭 Reflection Tracking (AKA The Blame Game)
- Document why your estimates were wrong
- Common entries: "Got distracted by memes", "Forgot humans need food", "Underestimated the universe's hatred for me"
- Build a comprehensive catalog of your own delusions

### 🎯 Random Test Mode
- Practice with fake scenarios like "How long to eat a sandwich?"
- Realize you can't even estimate sandwich consumption time correctly
- Question your entire existence while improving incrementally

## 🏃‍♀️ Getting Started (Prepare for Emotional Damage)

```bash
# Clone this repository of truth
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/timecalibr.git

# Install dependencies (this will take "just a minute")
npm install

# Start the server (estimated 30 seconds, actual time: varies by cosmic alignment)
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 and begin your journey of self-discovery
```

## 📱 How to Use (A Journey in Three Acts)

### Act I: The Prediction (Hope)
1. Visit `/predict` and make a time estimate
2. Feel confident and optimistic
3. Submit with the naive belief that you know yourself

### Act II: The Reality (Despair)
1. Actually do the task
2. Realize time is a flat circle and you are but a grain of sand
3. Visit `/log` to record your crushing defeat

### Act III: The Reckoning (Acceptance)
1. Check `/dashboard` to see your calibration score
2. Stare at charts that confirm your suspicions
3. Achieve enlightenment or book therapy

## 🏆 Achievement System

(Due to time restrictions, I was not able to implement this system. I would love to do so, though)

- **"Optimist"**: Underestimate 10 tasks in a row
- **"Realist"**: Get within 25% of actual time (rare)
- **"Time Lord"**: Achieve 80% calibration (mythical)
- **"Gave Up"**: Stop using the app for 30 days (most common)

## ⚠️ Warning Labels

- May cause existential crisis
- Not recommended for people with fragile egos
- Side effects include: accuracy, self-awareness, and the ability to show up on time
- Do not use before important meetings where confidence is required

## 🤝 Contributing

Found a bug? Feature request? Want to make the shame more accurate? We welcome contributions!

**Guidelines:**
- All pull requests must include at least one self-deprecating comment
- Bug reports should estimate how long the bug will take to fix (for science)
- Feature requests must explain why they'll make users feel worse about themselves

## 📊 Scientific Backing

This app is based on real psychological research about calibration and overconfidence bias. It's like having a psychology textbook that actively mocks you!

- Every project manager who's ever lived
