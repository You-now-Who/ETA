## 🎯 What is This Beautiful Disaster?

ETA is the app you knew that you needed but never found the time to make *(ironic, isn't it?)*. 

It's like having a personal trainer, but instead of making you sweat at the gym, it makes you sweat when you realize you estimated **"2 hours"** for a task that took you:
- 3 days
- 4 mental breakdowns  
- 1 family intervention
- Several existential crises

> **Fun Fact:** The app name "ETA" stands for "Estimated Time of Arrival" but really means "Eternal Torment & Agony" 😈

## 🤔 Why Does This Exist?

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Have you ever...**
- Told someone you'd be ready in "just 5 minutes" then showed up 45 minutes later with wet hair and one shoe?
- Estimated a project would take "a quick afternoon" then finished it during the next lunar eclipse?
- Said "I'll be there in 10 minutes" while still in your pajamas?

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Congratulations! You're human!** 🎉

This app is here to shame you into improvement with the power of **SCIENCE!** 📊

*Because someone needs to tell you that your time estimation skills are worse than a GPS in a tunnel.*

## 📱 How to Use (A Journey in Three Acts)

<div align="center">

*Like a Shakespearean tragedy, but with more charts and less poetry*

</div>

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" align="center">

### 🌅 Act I: The Prediction
***(Hope)***

1. Visit `/predict` and make a time estimate
2. Feel confident and optimistic  
3. Submit with the naive belief that you know yourself

*"This time will be different!"*

</td>
<td width="33%" align="center">

### 😱 Act II: The Reality  
***(Despair)***

1. Actually do the task
2. Realize time is a flat circle and you are but a grain of sand
3. Visit `/log` to record your crushing defeat

*"How did 2 hours become 2 days?!"*

</td>
<td width="33%" align="center">

### 📊 Act III: The Reckoning
***(Acceptance)***

1. Check `/dashboard` to see your calibration score
2. Stare at charts that confirm your suspicions
3. Achieve enlightenment or book therapy

*"I am become Time, destroyer of schedules"*
